            <p>Hello, growing up I was always curious about computers and in the 29 years of my life I still am curious. I was born and raised in the Eastern Cape, South Africa and am a 3rd of 5 kids (3 half siblings; older sister, older brother and younger sister, and one younger brother) I served my mission from the year 2017-2019 in the Botswana/Namibia Mission as the first missionary from my family. In recent years I've tried to catch up with my studies after mission but things just weren't working out and now I'm here to capitalize on things working out for the best</p>
